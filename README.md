# MCHM-Genetic-Screen

This repository is for supplemental material pertaining to the dissertation of Michael C. Ayers entitled "The role of genotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae on resistance to 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol."

Table S1: Full list of knockout strains found as hits in the genetic screen of the BY4742 collection. Includes ORF and gene names of all 329 hits from the screen. 4983 strains from the haploid knockout collection were assayed for growth in the presence of 300ppm MCHM on solid YPD media. While approximately 900 strains showed some noticeable growth differences on at least one replicate, the 329 strains showed clear growth differences on all 3 biological replicates, accounting for a stringent threshold for inclusion as a “hit” for the knocked out gene being required for MCHM resistance.

Table S2: Full results of significantly upregulated genes from RNAseq data in MCHM/YPD using BY4741 wildtype strain. Upregulated transcripts from the BY4741 RNAseq are listed in full. Included are the ORF names, as well as log2fold change and adjusted p-values supplied by the differential analysis. All genes are at least greater than a two-fold increase in expression in MCHM than YPD. Gene names, locations, and putative functions are concatenated to the rightmost columns of the table for further information on included ORFs.

Table S3: Full results of significantly downregulated genes from RNAseq data in MCHM/YPD using BY4741 wildtype strain. Downregulated transcripts from the BY4741 RNAseq are listed in full. Included are the ORF names, as well as log2fold change and adjusted p-values supplied by the differential analysis. All genes are at least greater than 2fold decreased in expression in MCHM than YPD. Gene names, locations, and putative functions are concatenated to the rightmost columns of the table for further information on included ORFs.
